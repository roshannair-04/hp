# 🧙‍♂️ Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak

This project creates a real-life **invisibility cloak effect** using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.  
It works by detecting a specific cloak color (e.g., red/green/blue) and replacing it with the background, making the cloak appear invisible — just like in Harry Potter! ⚡
